  <p>When you think of French cakes, you think “fabulous, fancy, and flamboyant”.</p>
   <p> France turned making pastries and baked goods 
        into an art form, but in addition to the</p>
       <p> showstoppers you see in the Pâtisserie window, the country is also known for its simple and rustic desserts </p> 
       <H2>Ingredients</H2>
       <ul>
        <li>3 large baking apples (such as Honeycrisp)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar for the top</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting</li>    
       </ul>

       <H2>Steps</H2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li> <p>Peel (or leave skin on) and core apples; cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, </p>
        <p>they won’t get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.</p> </li>
        <li>Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li><p>In another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</p> 
        <p>Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.</p><p> Add the second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture</p>
     <p>When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula.</p>   </li>
        <li><p>Fold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly</p>
        <P>mooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.</P></li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li><P>Remove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack,</P>
        <P>place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.</P></li>
        <li>well done</li>
